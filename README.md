# mendelson-as2
This is an unofficial Mendelson AS2 Community Server mirror that tracks the [official upstream SourceForge files](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mec-as2/files/).

The project can be built using maven. A few formatting fixes and minor patches have been applied to the source, but overall the goal of this repo is to welcome additional improvements to the project.

Project Roadmap:
- Building of WAR artifacts
- Jetty bundling / deployment scripts
- Update dependencies to modern versions
- Applying best practices when it comes to Java programming
- Formatting and typo fixes
- Add some crucial documentation that's sorely missing in the community version
